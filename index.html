                When looking for a roofing contractor, it's essential to make
                sure they are licensed and insured. Ask to see their license and
                insurance certificates, and make sure that the contractor's name
                is listed on both. You can also check with your state licensing
                board or the Better Business Bureau to verify the contractor's
                license and insurance.
